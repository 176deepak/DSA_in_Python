    "A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure that consists of nodes connected by edges. Each node in a binary tree has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. A binary tree is used to represent a hierarchical structure in which each node can have zero, one, or two children.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of a binary tree:\n",
    "1. **Root**: The topmost node in a binary tree is called the root. It serves as the starting point for traversing or accessing the tree.\n",
    "2. **Nodes**: Each element in a binary tree is a node. A node can contain data or information, and it may have zero, one, or two children nodes.\n",
    "3. **Edges**: Edges or links connect nodes to each other, defining the relationships within the tree.\n",
    "4. **Parent and Child Nodes**: Each node in a binary tree can be the parent of one or more child nodes. The nodes directly connected to a parent are referred to as its children. A node can have either zero children (a leaf node), one child, or two children.\n",
    "5. **Leaf Nodes**: Leaf nodes are nodes that have no children. They are the nodes at the bottom of the tree.\n",
    "6. **Height**: The height of a binary tree is the length of the longest path from the root to a leaf. It represents the number of edges in the longest path from the root to a leaf node. The height of a binary tree can vary depending on its structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary trees are fundamental data structures and are a building block for more complex data structures like AVL trees, Red-Black trees, and many others. They are versatile and can be adapted to various problems and scenarios."
