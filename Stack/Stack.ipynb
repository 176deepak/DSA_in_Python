    "A stack is a fundamental linear data structure in programming that follows the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle.

    "## Advantage and Disadvantage of Stack \n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Stacks:**\n",
    "1. **Efficiency:** Stacks are super quick for the most recent item (top of the stack), with O(1) time complexity. Adding and removing items is also speedy.\n",
    "2. **Easy Setup:** Stacks are easy to create and don't hog memory. You can make them with arrays or linked lists, and they work well.\n",
    "3. **Great for Some Problems:** Stacks are perfect for Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) scenarios, like tracking function calls and backtracking.\n",
    "4. **Predictable Behavior:** Stacks do what you expect, making them easy to use in software.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages of Stacks:**\n",
    "1. **Limited Access:** You can only get the top item. To reach deeper items, you have to remove stuff, which isn't efficient for some tasks.\n",
    "2. **Fixed Size (for Array-Based Stacks):** Arrays can cause problems if they overflow. Resizing them helps, but that's extra work.\n",
    "3. **Not for All Situations:** Stacks don't work well when you need to access random items in the middle. Other structures like arrays, lists, or trees are better for that.\n",
    "4. **No Multi-Tasking:** Stacks aren't for multiple threads or processes. You need extra tricks to make them play nice in multi-threaded or multi-process setups.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, stacks are handy for LIFO situations, offering speed and simplicity. Still, they can be limiting if you need more access to elements or deal with fixed-size arrays."
