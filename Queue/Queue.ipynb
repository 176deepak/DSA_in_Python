    "## Introduction\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "A queue is a linear data structure. It follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle, which means that the element that is added to the queue first will be the first one to be removed. \n",
    "For example, a line of people waiting for something, like at a ticket counter or in a cafeteria. The person who arrives first gets served first, and as new people join the line, they stand at the back and wait for their turn. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Queue Operations:**\n",
    "1. **Enqueue:** This operation adds an element to the back or end of the queue(from `Rear` end). When enqueue an element in queue, queue increase the value of rear by 1.\n",
    "2. **Dequeue:** This operation removes and returns the front element of the queue(from `front` end). When dequeue an element from queue, queue increase the value of front by 1.\n",
    "3. **Peek (or Front):** This operation allows you to view the front element of the queue without removing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here are some common types of queues:**\n",
    "1. **Linear Queue**: This is the most basic type of queue, where elements are stored in a linear or sequential manner. In a linear queue, elements are added at one end (`Rear`) and removed from the other end (`Front`), following the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle. It operates like a traditional queue or line.</br>\n",
    "2. **Circular Queue**: A circular queue is an extension of the linear queue in which the front and rear ends `both are connected`, forming a circular structure. When the rear end reaches the end of the queue, it wraps around to the beginning. This circular structure allows efficient use of space and is often used in situations where the queue should have a fixed size and elements should be reused when the queue is full.\n",
    "3. **Priority Queue**: In a priority queue, each element has an associated priority value. Elements are removed from the queue based on their priority, not strictly in the order they were added. Elements with higher priority are dequeued before those with lower priority. Priority queues are commonly used in tasks where certain tasks or elements need to be processed before others based on their importance.\n",
    "4. **Double-Ended Queue (Deque)**: A double ended queue or deque is a queue that allows elements to be added or removed from both ends, the front and the rear.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of queue type depends on the specific requirements of the application and the problem being solved. Different types of queues provide different trade-offs in terms of performance, order of processing, and handling of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some conditions on Queues(Linear)**\n",
    "1. Overflow condition:\n",
    "       if (front == 0) and (rear == maxsize-1)\n",
    "           Queue is full\n",
    "2. Underflow condition:\n",
    "       if rear < maxsize-1\n",
    "           Queue have empty space\n",
    "3. Enqueue check:\n",
    "       if rear == maxsize-1\n",
    "           Queue is full\n",
    "4. Dequeue check:\n",
    "       if rear < front\n",
    "           Queue is empty"

    "## Advantage and Disadvantage\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "`Advantages of Queues`\n",
    "1. **Order Preservation:** Queues maintain the order of elements based on the principle of First-In-First-Out (FIFO). The first element enqueued is the first to be dequeued, which is valuable in scenarios where order matters.\n",
    "2. **Synchronization:** Queues are useful for managing access to shared resources in concurrent or multi-threaded programming. They help prevent race conditions by ensuring that only one task accesses the resource at a time.\n",
    "4. **Task Scheduling:** In operating systems and job scheduling systems, queues are used to manage tasks or processes waiting to be executed. The task at the front of the queue is typically given priority.\n",
    "5. **Buffering and Flow Control:** Queues can be used to buffer data in scenarios where data production and consumption rates differ. They allow for smoother data flow and can prevent data loss or congestion.\n",
    "6. **Print Queue:** In computer systems, print queues are used to manage print jobs. Print requests are placed in a queue, and the printer processes them one by one in the order they were received.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Disadvantages of Queues:`\n",
    "1. **Limited Access:** Like stacks, queues offer limited access to elements. You can only access the front element, and accessing elements deeper in the queue requires dequeuing elements, which may not be efficient for certain operations.\n",
    "2. **Fixed Size (for Array-Based Queues):** If implemented as an array with a fixed size, a queue may run into issues if it overflows. Dynamic resizing can address this limitation but adds complexity.\n",
    "3. **Not Suitable for All Data Access Patterns:** Queues are not well-suited for scenarios where you need access to arbitrary elements in the middle of the data structure. For such cases, other data structures like arrays or lists may be more appropriate.\n",
    "4. **Overhead:** Queues can introduce some overhead in terms of memory usage and processing time due to the need to manage the order and track the front and rear of the queue.\n",
    "5. **Blocking Queues:** In some cases, blocking queues (queues that block or wait when empty or full) can lead to deadlocks or performance bottlenecks if not used properly. Careful synchronization and error handling are required.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, queues are valuable data structures for managing elements in a manner that preserves order and is suitable for various applications such as task scheduling, data buffering, and graph traversal. However, their limited access to elements and the potential for overflow or deadlock in certain scenarios should be considered when choosing a data structure for a specific use case."
